 * dashboard can separate genuinely different measurement bases:
 *
 *   - `band_reversion`        — vol-scaled band pierces (Bollinger,
 *                               Keltner, z-score, %B, recovery, HA)
 *   - `oscillator_reversion`  — oscillator-extreme reads (RSI, Stoch,
 *                               CCI, Stoch-RSI, Aroon)
 *   - `velocity_fade`         — fade a recent move (ATR-burst,
 *                               multi-bar return, RSI velocity, range
 *                               expansion, streak fade)
 *   - `ma_position`           — close vs. a moving-average baseline
 *                               (SMA / EMA position)
 *   - `pattern`               — single- or multi-bar candle shape
 *                               (pin bar, engulfing)
 *   - `divergence`            — indicator/price disagreement
 *                               (RSI divergence)
 *   - `structure_reversion`   — failed/swept breakout structure
 *   - `compression_continuation` — continuation after narrow/inside bars
 *   - `volatility_compression_continuation` — squeeze breakouts
 *   - `trend_quality` / `trend_continuation` / `trend_flip_continuation`
 *                               — directional trend-following signals
 *   - pullback, persistence, swing-structure, and body-sign families
 *                               — OHLC-only continuation/failure probes
 *   - volume/body/sequence families — orthogonal volume participation
 *                               and candle-body direction tests

/**
 * One concrete filter implementation. The framework guarantees:
 *
 *   1. `predict` is called with `bars` ordered ascending by
 *      `openTimeMs` and exactly `requiredBars(config)` entries long.
 *      The most recent CLOSED bar is `bars[bars.length - 1]`. The
 *      "prediction target" — the bar that just opened, whose
 *      `open` ≈ `bars[bars.length - 1].close` — is NOT in the array.
 *   2. `version` increments invalidate any cached results for this
 *      filter. Bump it whenever the body of `predict` changes the
 *      output for the same inputs (or the indicator math
 *      underneath does).
 *   3. `configSchema.parse(config)` is the only way the framework
 *      hands the filter a config. Defaults declared in the schema
 *      apply when a candidate registers with a partial config.
 *   4. `id` is the stable, snake_case identifier persisted on every
 *      filter_runs row. Renaming an id is equivalent to deleting
 *      the filter and adding a new one.
 *
 * `description` is for the dashboard tooltip — one or two sentences,
 * lay-readable but technically faithful (e.g. "Engages UP when RSI is
 * oversold (≤ `low`) and DOWN when overbought (≥ `high`); otherwise
 * abstains. Classic two-sided mean-reversion rule.").
